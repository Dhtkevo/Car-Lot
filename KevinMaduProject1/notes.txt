There are no known/unhandled bugs or missing functionality in this project.

There is one minor bug that would cause the shopper to become null and crash the program.

Steps to reproduce bug...
1. Enter information for a shopper
2. Open shopper form and close it without entering information/submitting the form.
3. Attempt to purchase a car

I handled this bug by checking for a null shopper, and if the shopper is null then 
display a message prompting the user to re-enter shopper information.

I've been pushing my commits to a github repo so i'm not sure if Visual studio will allow you to see my commit history.
I plan on uploading a screenshot of my commit history on github just in case.
