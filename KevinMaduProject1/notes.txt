There are no known/unhandled bugs or missing functionality in this project.

There is one minor bug that would cause the shopper to become null and crash the program.

Steps to reproduce bug...
1. Enter information for a shopper
2. Open shopper form and close it without entering information/submitting the form.
3. Attempt to purchase a car

I handled this bug by checking for a null shopper, and if the shopper is null then 
display a message prompting the user to re-enter shopper information.
